## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes refund expenses in the Claims Department to identify the key drivers of high claim costs and propose strategies to reduce expenses.

Over the past year, refund expenses surged to â‚¬17.5M, driven not by high-risk features but by high-volume car configurations. Using data analysis and visualization, the project provides insights into claim patterns, regional differences, and actionable recommendations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals & Scope

### Objective:

1. Identify which car features/configurations are driving refund costs.
2. Analyze claim frequency vs. cost to separate high-risk vs. high-volume effects.
3. Recommend strategies to reduce claim expenses.

### Scope of Analysis:

Data Source: Simulated Data 

Dataset size: 70,512 cars

Claims analyzed: 17,247 closed/processed claims

Refund expenses: â‚¬17.5M total payout

## ðŸ“Š Business KPIs

Total Cars Sold: 70K

Total Claims: 17.2K

Claim Rate: 24.5%

Total Paid Refunds: â‚¬17.5M

## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights

i) Claim rates stable at ~24% across most configurations.

ii) High refund cost â‰  High risk.

iii) The most expensive configurations are not defect-prone but simply most common.
Example: Cars with no tuning, airbags, no alarm system, no xenon lights â†’ â‚¬5.6M refunds (70% of sales).

iv) Geographic impact: a)Top refunds: Germany (â‚¬7.4M), France (â‚¬2.8M), Spain (â‚¬2.1M).
b) Highest average refund: Austria & Netherlands.

v) Seasonality in claims: Spike from Marchâ€“July, likely due to seasonal usage (travel/heating/cooling issues).

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. Feature-Based Acquisition Filter
2. Flag high-cost configurations before listing.
3. Apply stricter quality checks and fraud detection for risky segments.
4. Incentivize Security Features
5. Cars with alarms have lower claims.
6. Offer low-cost security upgrades to reduce risk.
7.Risk-Adjusted Pricing
8. Add margin for high-cost configurations.
9. Consider transparent "refund protection fee" for merchants.
